## Git Basics
I've just learned git basics and I might say that Git is fantastic!
- I've recognized much new information. I've found out about ```git rebase``` and ```git cherry-pick``` commands.
- I know ```git merge``` and ```git pull``` commands but I saw them at a different angle.Just amazing that command ```git pull``` combines at once 2 commands ```git fetch + git merge```.
- In my opinion ```git rebase``` and ```git merge``` are very useful but don't easy to comprehend.
